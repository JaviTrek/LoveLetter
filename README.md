# Love Letter
This project is meant to be used as a basic letter creation service. You can send a letter with a specific date and the other user will not see it until the date has elapsed.

## Tech Stack - MOAN
- **MongoDB**
- **OpenAI** for AI titles and images
- **AWS S3** to store images
- **Next.js** 14 with app router
  - TailwindCSS for styling.
- Hosted via Vercel.




## Purpose
This is a secret love project for my spouse since I'll be traveling abroad for work for a couple of months and this is like a little surprise.

Also I've been wanting to brush up my skills with TS and Next, I know it's nothing complex/hard to do but it's still fun.

## Vague commit messages
I believe this will be purely a solo project so, if the commit messages are sloppy, that's why.



# TODO
- Update messages depending on date
- display new/old messages
- show capability of "show more" (maybe takes to another page?)
-
